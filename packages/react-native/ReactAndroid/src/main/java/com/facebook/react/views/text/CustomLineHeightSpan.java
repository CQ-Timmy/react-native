   * So since we decided to be _very_ flexible with channel names, users have decided that they were gonna name their channels
   * shit like ‧͙⁺˚･༓☾text☽༓･˚⁺‧͙ | l̶̟̦͚͎̦͑̎m̵̮̥̫͕͚̜̱̫̺̪͍̯̉̂̔͌́̚̕a̶͖̫͍͇̯̯̭͎͋̅́̿́̕͘͘͝͝ò̶̧̢͎̃̋͆̉͠ | and other fun non-standard channel names.
   *
   * This caused issues with line heights, because the RN implementation decided that it would try as best as possible to
   * fit the text within the lineHeight that was given to it by the react component, causing text to be shifted upward
   * and look terrible (see: https://canary.discord.com/channels/281683040739262465/912423796915462154/101286117376867126
   * for an example).
   *
   * We (Jerry + Charles) decided that to fix this issue, we would instead ignore lineHeights _only_ if the text
   * height was larger than the lineHeight provided to it.
   *
   * This is a much simpler implementation that what was previously here.
   *
   * _IF_ the lineHeight is larger than the text height, we default to centering the text as much as possible within
   * that line height.
